# File Upload to Vector Database Feature

## Overview
Add a new "Files" section to the application that allows users to upload various file types (PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX, CSV) directly to the vector database for embedding and search capabilities.

## User Story
As a user, I want to upload documents from my computer to the knowledge base so that I can search and query their content through the chat interface.

## Feature Requirements

### Supported File Types
- PDF documents (.pdf)
- Microsoft Word documents (.docx)
- Plain text files (.txt)
- Markdown files (.md)
- CSV files (.csv)

### File Constraints
- Maximum file size: 10MB per file
- Maximum files per upload: 5 files
- Total storage quota: 100MB per user (future consideration)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation (Week 1)

#### Step 1.1: Install Required Dependencies
```bash
npm install pdf-parse mammoth formidable csv-parse
npm install --save-dev @types/formidable
```

#### Step 1.2: Create File Processor Library
Create `src/lib/file-processor.ts`:
- Implement `extractTextFromPDF()` using pdf-parse

```sql
ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN file_name TEXT;
ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN file_type VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN file_size INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN source_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'text';
```

#### Step 1.4: Create File Upload API Endpoint
Create `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`:

#### Step 5.2: Implement Error Handling
- File type rejection messages
- Size limit warnings
- Network error recovery
- Retry failed uploads

#### Step 5.3: Add File Icons
- Display appropriate icons for each file type
- Color coding for different file categories
- Visual status indicators

#### Step 5.4: Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly upload interface
- Touch-friendly drag and drop
- Responsive file cards/table

### Phase 6: Testing & Optimization (Week 3-4)

#### Step 6.1: Unit Tests
- Test file processors for each type
- Test chunking with various file sizes
- Test API endpoints

#### Step 6.2: Integration Tests
- Test full upload flow
- Test file deletion cascade
- Test search with file content

#### Step 6.3: Performance Optimization
- Implement file upload chunking for large files
- Add progress streaming
- Optimize text extraction algorithms
- Cache processed file results

#### Step 6.4: Security Hardening
- Implement file type verification (MIME type checking)
- Add virus scanning integration point
- Sanitize file names
- Rate limit upload endpoints

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. User selects files through UI
2. Client validates file types and sizes
3. Files uploaded to `/api/upload` endpoint
4. Server extracts text based on file type
5. Text is chunked using existing chunking logic
6. Chunks are embedded using OpenAI API
7. Document and chunks stored in PostgreSQL
8. File metadata returned to client
9. File appears in file list and becomes searchable
